We present new JVLA observations of the high-mass cluster-forming region W51A
from 2 to 16 GHz with resolution
$\theta_{fwhm}\approx0.3-0.5\arcsec$.  The data reveal a wealth of
observational results:
(1) Currently forming, very massive (proto-O) stars are traced by \ortho
\twotwo emission, suggesting that this line can be used efficiently as a
massive protostar tracer;
(2) there is a spatially distributed population of $\lesssim$mJy continuum sources,
including hypercompact \hii regions and candidate colliding wind binaries,
in and around the W51 proto-clusters;  and
(3) there are two clearly detected protoclusters, W51e and W51 IRS2, that are
gas-rich but may have most of their mass in stars within their inner $\lesssim0.05$
pc.  The
majority of the bolometric luminosity in W51 most likely comes from a third
population of OB stars between these clusters.
The presence of a substantial population of exposed O-stars coincident with
a population of still-forming massive stars, together with a direct measurement
of the low mass loss rate via ionized gas outflow from W51 IRS2, implies
that feedback is ineffective at halting star formation in massive
protoclusters.  Instead, feedback may shut off the large-scale accretion of
diffuse gas onto the W51 protoclusters, implying that they are evolving toward
a state of gas exhaustion rather than gas expulsion. Recent theoretical models
predict gas exhaustion to be a necessary step in the formation of
gravitationally bound stellar clusters, and our results provide an
observational validation of this process.
