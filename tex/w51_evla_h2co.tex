\section{Introduction}
\todo{Expand introduction - that is always last...}

The protoclusters within W51 contain many forming massive stars
\citep{Zhang1997a,Keto2008b,Zapata2008a,Zapata2009a,Zapata2010a,Goddi2015a,Shi2010a,Shi2010b}
and a few that have already reached the main sequence and are visible in the
infrared \citep{Barbosa2008a,Figueredo2008a}.
It is at a distance of 5.41 kpc \citep{Sato2010a,Xu2009a}.

The total luminosity of the W51 protocluster complex has been estimated a few
times using IRAS and KAO to measure the peak of the SED in the far infrared.
The measurements converge on $\sim8.3\ee{6} (D/5.1\mathrm{kpc})$ \lsun
\citep{Harvey1986a,Sievers1991a}.  It is therefore among the most luminous
star-forming regions in the Galaxy.

We present observations of the inner few parsecs of the W51 protocluster
forming region.  We refer to the whole region, including W51 Main (which
contains the W51e sources) and W51 IRS 2 as `W51A'.  Other names are explained
when they are used.

\section{Observations}
We used the JVLA in multiple bands and configurations.  In project 12B-365, we
observed in A-array in S and C bands with 2 GHz total bandwidth.  In project
13A-064, we observed in C-Band in C (1h) and A (5h) arrays and in Ku-band in D
(1h) and B (5h) arrays.  Our spectral coverage included \ortho \oneone 4.82966 GHz
and \twotwo at 14.488 GHz with 0.3 \kms resolution and H77$\alpha$ and H110$\alpha$
at 1 \kms resolution.

Data reduction was performed using CASA.  The pipeline-calibrated products were
used, then imaging was performed using CLEAN.  For most images discussed here, we
used uniform weighting.  The reduction scripts are included in a repository
\url{https://github.com/keflavich/w51evlareductionscripts}.

The observations and resulting images are summarized in Table
\ref{tab:observations}.

\section{Observational Results}
We report four key observational results: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Section \ref{sec:pointsources}: The detection of new continuum
        sources, which are most likely hypercompact \hii regions. 
    \item Section \ref{sec:twotwoemission}: The detection of \formaldehyde
        \twotwo emission around sources e2, e8, and W51 North
    \item Section \ref{sec:LOSvelo}: Measurements of line-of-sight velocities
        toward many ultracompact \hii regions using H77$\alpha$ and/or
        \formaldehyde
    \item Section \ref{sec:diffuseemission}: Detection of Orion-bar-like sharp
        edges to the W51 Main HII region, most likely tracing a
        photon-dominated region (PDR)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Continuum sources and photometry}
\label{sec:pointsources}
Our data are the most sensitive continuum observations yet performed on the W51
region.  We report new detections of several sources and concrete
identifications of others that were detected in previous data sets but not
reported.

We follow the naming scheme introduced by \citet{Mehringer1994a}.  For the
compact ($r<1\arcsec$) sources within 1 arcminute of W51e2, we use the name
W51e followed by a number.  We identify two new sources, e9 (19:23:43.654
+14:30:26.81) and e10 (19:23:43.956 +14:30:26.95), which were previously
detected but never officially named (as far as we were able to discover).
We additionally split source e8 into a north and south component, plus a more
extended molecular component e8mol.  We also identify a molecular component
between e1, e8, and e10, which we identify as e10mol.  The source positions
and approximate radii for resolved sources are listed in Table
\ref{tab:positions}.

\input{tables/source_positions.tex}

We include in this catalog any pointlike sources (at $\sim0.2-0.4\arcsec$
resolution) with emission in two bands, Ku and C (14 and 5 GHz).  We also
include candidate point sources that may instead be artifacts from the data
reduction process.  In order to identify point sources, we used
uniformly-weighted maps, which remove much of the extended emission and make
pointsource detection simpler, but this process also can result in local peaks
of the diffuse emission appearing to be pointlike.

The point source data is listed in Table \ref{tab:contsrcs}.  The Epoch column
describes the data source: Epoch 1 comes from \citet{Mehringer1994a}, Epoch 2
comes from \todo{[Ciriaco's Program]}, 12B-365, or 13A-064 (mid 2012-early
2013), and Epoch 3 (C-band only) comes from
13A-064 in 2014. For the multi-configuration combined images, we list the date
of the highest-resolution observations.  There are two flux density
columns.  The first shows the peak flux density, which in some
cases is negative because the source sits in a region affected by large angular
scale negative bowls.  The second, `Peak - Background', shows the peak flux
minus the lowest value within that same cutout region.  When these two values
agree, they are reliable, but when they differ significantly they are probably
affected by image reconstruction artifacts.

The photometry is performed by measuring the peak flux density within an
aperture centered on the source with a radius equal to the beam major FWHM; the
aperture is therefore about twice as large as the full extent of the source.
We also report `background-subtracted' flux densities, which are these peak
fluxes minus the minimum flux density in a box $6\times6$ beam FWHMs.  This
background-subtracted flux density is meant to account for negative bowling
that affects parts of the images; there are cases in which a bright point
source is seen on a deeply negative background such that the measured peak flux
is near zero.

\input{tables/pointsource_photometry.tex}

Figure \ref{fig:d4sed} shows the cutout images with apertures for the source
d4e.  \todo{Additional figures for all candidates are included in the Appendix.}

\Figure{figures/pointsource_seds/d4e_SED.png}
{Cutouts of the source W51 d4e and its SED.
The red circle shows the source aperture used to measure the peak and total
flux.  The Epochs are indicated as E1, E2, and E3.
In the SED plot, the dark and light red show the 1-$\sigma$ and 3-$\sigma$
noise levels.
Green points are from Epoch 1, blue points are Epoch 2, and red points are
Epoch 3.  Squares show the peak flux density, circles show the
`background-subtracted' flux density - i.e., the peak minus the minimum value
in the map.
The dotted curve shows a linear SED ($S_\nu \propto \nu$) and the dashed shows
a power-law curve with $\alpha=2$, i.e. $S_\nu \propto \nu^2$.  Both curves are
normalized to go through the 12.1 GHz Epoch 2 data point.  In this case, all of
the Epoch 1 (green) points are within the noise, while all of the Epoch 2 and 3
(blue and red) points are detected at $>5$-$\sigma$.
}
{fig:d4sed}{0.5}{6.5in}

\subsubsection{Variability}
The multi-epoch data demonstrate that some of these sources are variable.  The
most convincing case for variability is in the (double) source d4 (Figure
\ref{fig:d4sed}.  In the \citet{Mehringer1994a} data, there is no hint of
emission at this location, with a 5-$\sigma$ upper limit of 1 mJy.  At the same
position and frequency in 2014, there is a 1.2 mJy source at the position of
d4e.  The case for variability in other sources is weaker but nonetheless
suggestive.

\todo{Move this somewhere relevant.}
We found a small offset between the 1994 and 2014 images using a
cross-correlation method (\url{image-registration.rtfd.org}); the 2014 data
were shifted by 0.16\arcsec, 0.20\arcsec to the southeast from the 1994 data.
\todo{There also appears to be some "squeezing" mode, which is inexplicable.
It probably makes more sense to centroid on e2 and match that way.}


\subsubsection{Source Associations}
We compare our extracted source catalog with the MOXC Chandra X-ray catalog
\citep{Townsley2014a}.  Only two of the compact HII regions are close enough to
X-ray sources to plausibly be associated with them.  Both lobes of d4 are
0.3\arcsec from MOXC 192339.62+143130.3 and d6 is 0.3\arcsec from MOXC
192341.23+143111.8.  These separations may indicate that either the HII regions
in the MOXC point sources are associated with diffuse material, e.g. outflows,
near stars rather than the stars themselves.  There are a handful of X-ray
sources within W51 IRS2 that could be associated with faint HCHII regions that
we do not detect due to confusion, but these could also be associated with
outflowing material (e.g., the Lacy jet; see Section \ref{sec:lacyjet}).  The
lack of correlation between X-ray and HCHII regions clearly indicates that the
OB stars within these HCHII regions are weak X-ray emitters, \todo{unlike W3(OH)?}.  

\todo{Compare to NIR catalogs: there were (nearly) no associations, so this should
be succinct.  Table?}


\todo{Is this a worthwhile observation?  The flux distribution of detected
sources at C-band (4.9 GHz) is essentially flat from 1\ee{-4} to 1\ee{-2} Jy.
There is a hint of a power-law or bimodal distribution from 1\ee{-4} to
1\ee{-1} Jy at 14.1 GHz.  The distribution probably reflects varying optical
depth.}

\subsection{\formaldehyde \twotwo emission}
\label{sec:twotwoemission}
We detect \formaldehyde \twotwo emission around W51e2, W51e8, in a region
between e1, e8, and e10, and in W51 North.  We report the tentative detection
of an extended structure between e2 and e1, though this structure is weak
and could be an artifact from the image reconstruction process.

\todo{Explain further.  Probably requires a figure.}
The W51e emission sources show signs of self-absorption around $v\sim55$ \kms,
close in velocity to the nadir of the W51e2 spectrum.  A diffuse cloud is
visible in absorption against the HII region toward the south at this same
velocity, so it seems that the W51e cluster is either embedded within the
$\sim55$ \kms cloud or behind it.  The cloud wraps around the W51e cluster at
lower velocities, so it seems more likely they are embedded within it.  All of
the W51e sources show absorption against the 68 \kms cloud, so they lie behind
it.

The fitted emission line parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:emission22}.

\input{tables/H2CO22_emission_spectral_fits}

\subsection{Line-of-sight velocities}
\label{sec:LOSvelo}
We have detected H77$\alpha$ emission from many of the ultracompact and
hypercompact \hii regions within W51.  We report their line-of-sight velocities
as measured from gaussian profile fits to their extracted spectra.

The H77$\alpha$ emission line parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:h77a}, and
the \para \twotwo absorption line parameters are in Table \ref{tab:absorption22}.
%The emission line parameters are only relevant for source e8mol.

The e5 and e6 sources are close to one another (separation 3.1 \arcsec, or
projected distance 0.08 pc), and both exhibit \formaldehyde absorption at 62-63
\kms.  e6 is detected in H77$\alpha$ at 68 \kms, suggesting that the true
velocity of both e5 and e6 may not be the same as the \formaldehyde absorption
lines, \emph{but} the line profile of the e6 H77$\alpha$ line suggests that the
velocity measurement may be affected by image reconstruction artifacts from
50-63 \kms.

\input{tables/H77a_spectral_fits}

\subsection{Diffuse emission features}
\label{sec:diffuseemission}
There are a few new notable continuum emission features detected in our data
that were not seen in previous shallower data.

Near source e11, there is a bow-shaped feature (Figure \ref{fig:e11bow}).
There are no known associated sources at shorter wavelengths, though in Spitzer
bands there is some diffuse emission at this location.  The bow-like structure
points away from e11, suggesting that it is the driving source.

\Figure{figures/diffuse/e11_bow.png}
{A bow-shaped feature toward the northeast of the source e11 in the Ku-band
continuum image.  The feature resembles the bow shocks of Herbig-Haro object,
but is more likely to be an HII region given its smooth structure.}
{fig:e11bow}{0.5}{6.5in}

The source d3 is a diffuse HII region with radius $r\sim1.9$\arcsec.  It is
associated with a Spitzer source and the 2MASS source 2MASX J19233591+1431288.
The sources d3, e1, e6, and e7 are compact (0.02-0.07 pc) and fairly round;
they are classed as ultracompact HII regions.

The diffuse emission associated with W51 Main traces a broad arc that has been
seen in many previous data sets.  The new deeper, higher-resolution data are
dramatically improved.  Where in previous observations, a relatively smooth and
clumpy structure was seen, the new images reveal a network of wispy,
filamentary structures.  Figure \ref{fig:w51mainpeak} shows the region between
the W51e and W51 IRS2 clusters.  While this area contains few clear individual
sources, it accounts for the majority of the radio luminosity of the W51 Main
region and about half the total luminosity of the W51 Main/IRS2 complex.

The filamentary structures in the W51 Main peak are unresolved along the short
axis, with aspect ratios $>25$.   These resemble the ``stringlike ionized
features'' noted by \citet[][see
\url{http://images.nrao.edu/402}]{Yusef-Zadeh1990a}, which are associated
primarily with the Orion Bar PDR and its fainter cousin to the northeast.  The
similarity suggests that these features are PDRs, highlighting the sharp
interaction points between the HII region and the surrounding molecular cloud.

The two most prominent of these sharp features are on opposite sides of the W51
Peak.  The long vertical filament at RA = 19:23:42.4 (Filament A) approximately
faces W51e, while the S-shaped filament at RA=19:23:41.6 (Filament B) faces
nothing in particular.  The presence of multiple features raises questions
about the ionizing source.  In Orion, the Trapezium is 0.2 pc in projection
from the Bar PDR.  The left filament is 0.6 pc from the W51e cluster, which
contains enough O-stars to illuminate the filaments, but it is not clear
whether there is a clear line-of-sight from those stars, which appear to be
deeply embedded in molecular material, to the filament.  It is possible that
there are additional OB stars embedded in the W51 Peak driving much of its
luminosity that have never been resolved because they are confused with the
ionized nebula they produce.

traced by elongated features parallel to the arrow and a rounded feature to the
southwest.  A counterpart to the northeast is barely visible.
}
{fig:w51mainpeak}{1}{3.5in}

Additionally, the W51 Main ridge is cleanly detected in H77$\alpha$.  Filament
B peaks in the range 40-50 \kms.  From its sharp start toward the southeast,
there is continuous H77$\alpha$ emission toward the northeast from 40 to 80
\kms.

The H77$\alpha$ lines reveal two bubbles that overlap along the line of sight but
are clearly distinct in velocity.  A smaller bubble at 40 \kms shows a velocity
gradient orthogonal to the gradient seen next to filament A, increasing in
velocity from southwest to northeast; this gradient may trace the edges of an expanding
spherical shell.  The large bubble is centered at about 65 \kms and does not
exhibit any clear gradients.

The HII region between W51 Main and W51 IRS 2 appears connected to the W51 IRS2
bubble in the continuum, but it peaks at around 75 \kms.  Along this region,
there are weak `striations' at PA 126 degrees, vaguely orthogonal to a line
pointing back to IRS 2.  These striations are similar in scale to PSF artifacts
from bright pointlike sources, but no such artifaces are seen at this PA
elsewhere in the image and they are smoother than similar features, so they are
probably real.  They may trace the outer edge of the expanding IRS 2 region.
There is also an arc to the southwest of this between-clusters region.

The IRS2 region peaks in velocity around 62 \kms at the center, but exhibits a
consistent gradient from its center to its surroundings, with a more extended
component peaking around 47 \kms.  There is a clear shell around IRS2
with maximum projected radius 21\arcsec (0.5 pc; Figure \ref{fig:w51irs2}).
There is a prominent sharp edge feature extending to the northeast from the
central cluster: it may trace the outflow of hot material from the cluster.

Parts of the shell close to IRS2 are detected in radio recombination lines
(H77$\alpha$), but the regions marked in Figure \ref{fig:w51irs2} with red
arrows are not.  The shell to the northwest peaks at $v_{lsr}=37.5$ \kms, and a
gradient is observed from that shell to the peak velocity of IRS2 at $v_{lsr} =
62.6$ \kms.  The velocity structure is inconsistent with spherical outflow, but
it is consistent with a conical flow structure like that expected near
circumstellar disks.  This flow structure likely indicates that the cluster has
evacuated a large cavity approximately along the line of sight, which is
consistent with the low observed extinction toward IRS2.  

\todo{Contours at some velocities?}

region.  A V-shaped feature to the north (cyan arrow) may highlight the edge of
gas flows out of the cluster, extending to the long linear feature pointing
northeast (blue arrow); the corresponding linear feature to the northeast is
\emph{not} observed at Ku-band and is likely to be an imaging artifact.  An
apparent shell is observed centered on the IRS2 cluster, with edge
features to the south and east (red arrows).

\section{Analysis}
\subsection{The stellar mass}

We have re-measured the infrared luminosity of the W51 protoclusters using Herschel
Hi-Gal data \citep{Molinari2010a,Traficante2011a}, fitting an SED from the 70
to 500 \um with a single blackbody component.  While this is not a very good
measurement of the dust temperature - multiple temperature components are
evident \citep{Sievers1991a} - it provides a good approximation to the total
infrared luminosity, which is dominated by a single warm ($\sim60$ K) component.  The
infrared luminosity is about $L\sim2\ee{7}$ \lsun within a 2 pc radius, which includes
both the W51 IRS2 and W51 Main protoclusters.  It does not include the
mid-infrared luminosity, which may provide an additional $\sim25-50\%$ based on
the IRAS measurements. A luminosity $L=2\pm0.5\ee{7}$ \lsun implies a stellar
mass $M_{cl} = 6700 \pm 2300$ \msun, with a corresponding number of O-stars
(greater than 20 \msun) $N_O = 19 \pm 6$.

Of these expected $\sim20$, we know of 6 as detected O-stars.  \citet{Figueredo2008a} found
4 exposed O-type stars and \citet{Barbosa2008a} found an additional two with
strong infrared excess.  None of these coincide with ultracompact or
hypercompact \hii regions, but all are in the bright and diffuse IRS2 region.

\citet{Mehringer1994a} found an additional 8 ultracompact and hypercompact \hii
regions, all of which appear to be B0 or earlier based on their radio-derived
ionizing photon luminosity.  In this work, we report a handful more.
The other 9-20 O-stars expected to have \emph{already} formed given the
observed total luminosity may be these most luminous hypercompact \hii regions.
However, it is difficult to explain the total luminosity of the region from hypercompact
HII regions alone, since their emission is necessarily confined to a small region
and they contribute minimally to the overall radio luminosity.

Another possibility is that the remaining O-stars are embedded in or near the
``shell'' structure of the W51 Main region (Figure
\ref{fig:coverview_diffuse}).  This region dominates the luminosity of W51 Main
and is bright enough in near-infrared and radio continuum emission to make
detection of point sources impossible, explaining why no O-stars have been
previously detected.  

%However, given the shell-like structure of this loop around
%W51 Main, it seems likely that at least some of the shell-illuminating sources
%are near the W51 e1/e2 cluster.

The present stellar mass as inferred from the infrared luminosity is a lower
limit on the final mass of the cluster.  Star formation in W51 is ongoing and
is unlikely to cease until supernovae begin to explode, since even ionized gas
is presently gravitationally bound
\citep{Ginsburg2012a,Bressert2012a,Ginsburg2015a}.
The final mass of the clusters will be at least $\sim7\ee{3} + 4\ee{4} \eta$ \msun,
where $4\ee{4}$ \msun is the approximate dense gas mass within $\sim2$ pc and
$\eta$ is a star formation efficiency, likely to be at least 10\% in the dense
gas, so $M_{final} \gtrsim 1.1\ee{4}$ \msun.

%The O3 or O4 star W51d spectrally typed by \citet{Barbosa2008a} is probably
%illuminating the majority of the ionized gas in the IRS2 region.
% It is
% particularly impressive, though, since the star is shining through a layer of
% molecular gas that extincts the star.

% Can W51d be illuminating the W51 Main HII region?

\subsection{\formaldehyde emission features}
While \formaldehyde \oneone and \twotwo are commonly observed in absorption,
the \oneone line has only been observed in emission in our galaxy as a maser
\citep{Araya2007b}.  The \twotwo line has been observed in emission in the
starburst M82 \citep{Mangum2008a}, behind the Orion nebula
\citep{Evans1975a,Kutner1976a,Batrla1983a,Johnston1983a,Bastien1985a,Wilson1989a},
$\rho$ Ophiucus B \citep{Loren1980a,Loren1983a,Martin-Pintado1983a,Wadiak1985a},
and DR 21 \citep{Wilson1982a,Johnston1984a}.  However, the \twotwo line is more
commonly observed in absorption at large distances.

We have detected 3 regions of \twotwo emission in the W51 region, all
corresponding to previously detected hot \ammonia cores
\citep{Zhang1997a,Goddi2015a}.  The bright
maser source W51e2 is partially surrounded by a `halo' of \formaldehyde \twotwo
emission to its northeast; the \hchii region itself shows only \twotwo
absorption because the continuum source has a high brightness temperature
(Figure \ref{fig:w51bridge22emispec} and Figure \ref{fig:w51mainemicontours}).
The \hchii region W51e8 exhibits extended \twotwo emission, including a
somewhat
diffuse region stretching between W51e4 and W51e1.  Finally, in W51 IRS 2,
there is extended \twotwo emission stretching between W51d1 and W51d2, adjacent
to the ammonia masers observed by \citet{Zhang1995a} and more recently
\citet{Goddi2015a}, and aligned with the
\citet{Zapata2010a} W51 North Disk (Figure \ref{fig:w51northcore}).

\FigureTwo
{figures/irs2outflow/IRS2_core_on_cont22.png}
{figures/irs2outflow/IRS2_core_on_NACO_K.png}
{The W51 North core shown in emission in contours overlaid on (a) the 14 GHz
continuum and (b) the NACO K-band continuum image.  The contours are at 3
mJy/beam at velocities 56 to 60 \kms at 0.5 \kms intervals.
}
{fig:w51northcore}{1}{3.5in}

In all cases, the emission is extended and spread smoothly over multiple
velocity channels (Figures \ref{fig:w51n22emispec},
\ref{fig:w51bridge22emispec}, \ref{fig:w51e2emispec}, \ref{fig:w51e1emispec}).
It is therefore not maser emission.

%There is not a 1-1 detection.  But my judgement on this has varied.
None of these detections have corresponding \oneone emission.  This
nondetection is likely because our brightness sensitivity at C-band is very
poor.  Additionally, the foreground cloud is a much stronger absorber in the
\oneone line, so any emission is likely to be obscured by foreground
absorption.

%\todo{
%The physical conditions required to produce these extremely bright emission
%regions, with $T_B \gtrsim 500$ K (40 mJy) in the FWHM$\approx0.4$\arcsec (2000
%au) beams, can be explained either as thermalized hot gas or radiatively pumped
%emission.
%}

%\todo{
%The observed high brightness temperatures are similar to the extremely high
%temperatures reported by \citet{Zapata2010a}.  The excitation temperature must
%be $T\sim900$ K at the \formaldehyde \twotwo $\tau=1$ surface.  However, such a
%high temperature is very near the regime in which \formaldehyde would be
%collisionally dissociated.
%}

%\todo{
%A second possibility is that the \formaldehyde is radiatively pumped, resulting
%in a large non-collisionally-driven emission.  Vibrationally excited
%\formaldehyde has infrared
%transitions around 3.5 and 6 \um \citep{Al-Refaie2015a}, so radiative pumping
%requires a very strong radiation field with $T\gtrsim1000$ K.  Such a radiation
%field is consistent with the presence of high-mass young stars.  To avoid
%radiative dissociation, and especially in W51 North, to avoid creating a large
%\hii region, the radiation field must be cooler than $T < 10000$ K,
%implying that the proto-O-star \citep[as inferred from its luminosity and its
%kinematically-derived mass][]{Zapata2008a,Zapata2009a} is presently at a later
%spectral type.
%}

%The required column density for \twotwo
%to become optically thick depends on the velocity gradient and abundance; assuming
%$dV/dR = 1$ \kms \perpc and $X=10^{-9}$, the .

%these are the same...
% Our continuum measurements tighten the limits presented by \citet{Zapata2010a},
% with 5-sigma upper limits of 1 mJy at both C and Ku-band.

The W51e2 and W51e8 cores both exhibit peak brightness temperatures
$T\sim30-60$ K.  W51e8 seems an excellent analog to the W51 North core, at
least in terms of its gas density (based on the \formaldehyde \twotwo emission
detection) and temperature.  We have detected a weak extended continuum source
in e8, with a peak $S_{15 GHZ} \approx 2$ mJy and $S_{5 GHz} \approx 1$ mJy,
both consistent with the limits on W51North, where confusion from IRS 2 may
prevent a detection.  W51e8 contains a hypercompact HII region, and therefore
an accreting massive star, so it is likely that W51 North does as well.

\subsubsection{An extended molecular structure (a `filament')}
There is a `bridge' structure connecting the e8 and e2 cores.  This structure
was seen in \citet{Zhang1997a}, but was poorly resolved and could have been
dismissed as an artifact of the dirty beam.  This bridge is fainter than either
of the cores but clearly detected (Figure \ref{fig:w51bridge22emispec},
\ref{fig:w51mainemilabels}, and \ref{fig:w51mainemicontours}).

%It is also hot, $T_B\gtrsim300$ K at peak,
%and presumably very dense.

%The gas temperatures must either be driven by internal star formation, possibly
%a very early stage massive star like W51 North with no HII region yet formed,
%or the bridge is heated by the cluster of surrounding massive stars.  The
%thermal Jeans mass in this bridge is $M_J = 10.0 \left(\frac{T}{300
%K}\right)^{3/2} \left(\frac{n}{10^7 \percc}\right)^{-1/2}$ \msun, implying that
%any fragments will be very large or, more likely, fragmentation is prevented.

The bridge could in principle have been created by the ejection of e2 from the
e1 cluster.  However, the maser proper motions of \citep{Sato2014a} show that
e2 and e1 have almost no motion relative to one another.  To achieve their
current separation at a motion of 1 mas \peryr (25 \kms), which is an upper
limit on their relative motion, they would have had to separate 5-10 kyr ago.
The current data do not rule out this scenario, but neither do they strongly
favor it.  It is more likely that this bridge feature traces the parent filament
from which both the e1 and e2 clusters have formed.

% \subsection{Explanation of the hot gas}
% The high observed temperatures could be an indication either of genuinely hot
% molecular gas or of radiative pumping of the \formaldehyde molecules.  In
% either case, an intense source of radiation must be present; the primary
% difference is whether the excitation is driven by photons or collisions with
% the local dust.
% 
% Collisionally excited gas at these high temperatures implies a high density as
% well, which in turn implies frequent high-energy collisions between molecules.
% It is likely that the high-end tail of these collisions will result in rapid
% dissociation of the molecules.  Since \formaldehyde and \ammonia are both
% relatively complex, with \ammonia forming slowly in cold gas in the absence of
% CO \todo{[citation needed]}, re-formation of the molecules would not provide a
% sufficient population for our observations.  We therefore favor radiative
% (infrared) pumping as the explanation for the high observed brightness.  The gas
% must still be warm, $T\gtrsim200$ K \citep{Henkel2013a}, but not quite as hot
% as we might naively infer.  \citet{Mangum1993a} determined that infrared
% pumping begins to be significant for \formaldehyde when temperatures approach
% $T\gtrsim150$ K (see their Appendix C).
% 
% Normally \ammonia metastable transitions are cited as good tracers of the gas
% temperature because their relative populations can only be set by collisions;
% there are no radiative transitions connecting the K-ladders.  However, high
% radiation temperatures can easily excite the higher vibrational levels of
% \ammonia, which can then decay into different K-ladders \citep[][gives an
% overview of the selection pseudo-rules]{Henkel2013a}.  Therefore, temperatures
% inferred from \ammonia may be inaccurate in these hot cores.

\subsection{The Lacy jet}
\label{sec:lacyjet}
\citet{Lacy2007a} reported the detection of very high velocity ionized gas
in the mid-infrared [Ne II] 12.8\um and S IV 10.5\um lines.  They observe the
gas at a velocity blueshifted about 100 \kms from the IRS2 ionized and molecular
gas velocity.  We have detected the same feature in the H77$\alpha$ RRL.
The RRL shows the same position-velocity structure as the infrared ionized
features.  No redshifted counterflow is detected (Figure \ref{fig:lacyjetslice}).

One minor but notable feature of the H77$\alpha$ flow is that it is very close
to the rest velocity of the He77$\alpha$ line.  If \citet{Lacy2007a} had not
already unambiguously identified the high velocity of this feature in two
lines, we would have assumed it to be slightly redshifted Helium.

+14:31:07.9536 to 19:23:39.4176 +14:31:04.7172, position angle 258\arcdeg.
The blueshifted lobe is evident at -50 \kms in both cubes, and neither show a
redshifted counterpart.  The H77$\alpha$ data reveal that there is truly no
counterpart, ruling out the possibility that it was simply too extincted to be
observed in the infrared.}
{fig:lacyjetslice}{1}{3.5in}

This outflow is close to W51 North, which is a likely driver of the outflow based
on the highly excited \ammonia around it \citep{Henkel2013a,Goddi2015a}.  However,
the accreting O-star W51 IRS 2E is also very close to the outflow and could plausibly
be the driver \citep{Barbosa2008a}.  IRS 2E is the brightest X-ray source in
W51 with a harder X-ray spectrum than other sources in the region, and it emits
most of its energy in iron fluorescence lines, indicating that there is a very
strong interaction with dense material around it \citep{Townsley2014a}.

\subsection{The velocity dispersion in the W51e cluster}
\label{sec:vdisp}
We detect H77$\alpha$ toward 6 of the 8 hyper/ultra compact \hii regions in the
W51 Main (W51e) cluster; 4 of these 6 are firm detections and two are weak.  We
also measure a velocity from the \formaldehyde emission toward e8.  The
resulting 1D velocity dispersion is $\sigma=2.0$ \kms if we exclude sources e9
and e10; with e9 and e10 included the dispersion increases to 4.2 \kms, which
suggests that the uncertainty on those two sources renders their velocity
measurements unreliable.  This velocity dispersion is confined to
$r<5.4\arcsec$ or $r<0.13$ pc.  Assuming the stars are virialized (which is
probably not a good assumption), the implied mass is 350-1600 \msun, or an \hh
number density $6\ee{5} < n(\hh) < 2\ee{7}$ \percc.

The e1 subcluster is more compact, with $r=2.9$ \arcsec (0.07 pc), and its
velocity dispersion is $\sigma=2.0$ \kms.  It is more symmetric and a virial
assumption may be more accurate here.  Its implied density
is $n(\hh)\sim2\ee7$ \percc.

Given the mass of W51 Main and its $\sim10\kms$ escape velocity, all of these
(proto)stars are clearly bound to the gas.

The red curve shows the fit.  The lower spectrum shows the fit residual, with
the dashed line indicating the zero level.  The baselines are imperfect, but we
have made no effort to subtract them during the spectral fitting, instead
assuming that the image-based continuum subtraction is accurate.

\subsection{The nature of the continuum sources}
The point sources are all most likely to be hypercompact HII regions.  All that
are detected at low frequencies (2-6 GHz) are also detected at 15 GHz.  Many of
these sources have peculiar spectral energy distributions, with maxima at 2 and
15 GHz and a minimum at 6 GHz.  These SEDs are not easily explained by either
simple HII region models or as synchrotron emission sources.  However, the
association of all of these sources with the W51 region - all are within
$\sim2\arcmin$ of the central clusters - means they are unlikely to be
background galaxies.  

Given the faintness of these sources ($S_{5 GHz} \sim 1$ mJy), they must be
very small or optically thin if they are free-free emission sources.  A 1 mJy
source has a brightness temperature of 1000 K in our uniformly-weighted C-band
observations, which implies either that the HII region is optically thin, with
$\tau < 0.1$, or very small, with $ff<0.1$.  Given a beam radius of 0.3\arcsec,
the implied upper limit size for an optically thick source is 2 mpc (500 AU).

In typical analysis of HCHII regions, one can distinguish these scenarios by
examining the spectral index.  An optically thick source would have a spectral
index $\alpha=2$, i.e. $S_\nu \propto \nu^2$.  However, excepting e2, none of
the sources in our catalog exhibit such a slope.  Most sources have
$\alpha\sim1$ or $\alpha\sim0$ and a minimum at 6 GHz.  Free-free emission does
not readily explain these SEDs unless the source size is varying as a function
of frequency, which is possible.  Another possibility is that these sources
exhibit both free-free and synchrotron emission.

The diffuse HII regions are unambiguous, though the set of 4 ultracompact HII
regions with similar size is interesting.  All four of d3, e1, e6, and e7 have
similar sizes (0.02-0.07 pc) and are fairly round and symmetric.  They exhibit
some variations in surface brightness but are essentially circular.  In a
classical view of an expanding spherical HII region, these sources are at early
but very similar evolutionary stages.  Assuming that these all went through a
hypercompact HII region phase, and assuming that all of the hypercompact and
ultracompact HII regions within W51 go through the same phases at the same
rate, the ultracompact HII phase must be 10-30\% as long as the hypercompact
HII phase.  However, both of these assumptions are questionable.


\subsection{Sources of illumination in the extended HII regions}
There are many extended HII regions associated with the W51 cluster area.
While some have obvious driving sources, the W51 Main region seems not to - the
hypercompact HII regions are too small and not leaky enough.  If the
hypercompact HII regions were illuminating the W51 Main, we would expect
to see some traces of ionized features between e1/e2 and the lobe, or we would
expect not to see the O-stars as hypercompact HII regions at all.
Additionally, at the W51 Peak position, we have discovered multiple overlapping
bubbles at different line-of-sight velocities with centers far from both the
W51 IRS2 and W51e clusters.

We therefore suggest that a significant fraction of the luminosity in the W51A
region, and perhaps all from the W51 Main region, comes from a
partially-embedded population of stars that is extremely confused with the
luminous HII region it generates.

The different velocities of the HII bubbles in W51 Main suggest that there
are interacting, expanding bubbles, which in turn implies that there is a separation
between the driving sources of at least the bubble sizes, $\sim0.2-0.3$ pc.  
The W51 Peak cluster is therefore less dynamically evolved than W51 IRS2 and W51e,
which are both centrally concentrated.

\subsection{The future evolution of the W51 clusters and molecular cloud}
\todo{Some background on the FIR radiation pressure mechanisms is needed.}
The W51 clusters are likely to reach a very high star formation efficiency,
since the escape velocity is greater than the sound speed in ionized gas
\citep{Ginsburg2012a,Bressert2012a}.  If they really are forming one or more
young massive cluster, though, the gas must be evacuated or exhausted to 
achieve a final appearance like that of NGC 3603 or Trumpler 14.

Because IRS 2 is already readily seen in the near-infrared, it is clear that
the cluster leaks photons.  Since long-wavelength photons are not trapped,
radiation pressure is probably not going to be efficient; the FIR optical depth
term of \citet{Murray2010a} is very small.  Radiative trapping is only
relevant within the $<2\arcsec$ ultracompact HII regions, in which the FIR optical
depth exceeds unity.

The ongoing accretion onto the source IRS2E and probable ongoing accretion onto
the hot cores and HCHII regions throughout these clusters implies that ionizing
radiation is, at present, not halting star formation.  The presence of
accreting stars within large HII regions further confirms that ionizing
radiation and ionized gas pressure is inadequate to stop star formation in the
clusters.

We therefore anticipate that the clusters will continue to consume the dense
gas they presently contain until it is either exhausted or some other feedback
mechanism takes over.  Other feedback mechanisms may be stellar winds, direct
radiation pressure (assuming a single scattering event),  or supernovae.

Since the free-fall time is very short within these clusters ($t_{ff} < 0.5$
Myr out to 2.5 pc containing 5\ee{4} \msun of gas), supernovae will not affect
their formation.  However, once the clusters have exhausted gas locally, there
is both plenty of time and a relatively free path from the clusters to the rest
of the molecular cloud.  The binding energy of a $10^6$ \msun, $r=50$ pc 
molecular cloud is only about $10^{51}$ ergs, so a single supernova perfectly
coupled to the gas could unbind it all.  The $\sim20$ O-stars presently formed,
plus at least that many expected to form, will provide more than enough energy
to unbind the whole GMC.

% In order to match star formation relations, the overall star formation
% efficiency of the cloud must be limited to \todo{10\% ?? [citation needed]}.
% If the cluster progresses to 100\% efficiency, as we predict, the rest of the
% cloud must be limited to XX.

\section{Conclusions}

The \formaldehyde \twotwo 14.488 GHz transition is a good tracer of early-stage
very massive star formation.  It will be a powerful tool for studying the earliest
stagest of high-mass star formation throughout the Galaxy with a Square
Kilometer Array if the high-frequency end includes this transition.  Ongoing
JVLA surveys (e.g., KuGARS, PI Thompson,
\url{http://library.nrao.edu/proposals/catalog/10267}) may detect a significant
additional population of proto-O-stars.

The detected \uchii and \hchii regions and infrared-detect O-stars do not fully
account for the luminosity of the W51 region.  We argue that more O-stars
are hiding within the bright shell/ridge between the two clusters.  Since this
region is by turns both extremely bright in nebular emission and reflection and
heavily extincted in the near-infrared, deep, high resolution infrared
observations are the best hope for detecting the hidden stars and completing
the massive star census in the region.
