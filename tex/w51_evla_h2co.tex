{
We present new JVLA observations of the high-mass cluster-forming region
W51 Main / IRS2.  The data reveal a wealth of observational results:
(1) We detect \ortho \twotwo emission tracing forming very massive (proto-O) stars,
suggesting that this line can be used efficiently as a massive protostar tracer
with future instruments
(2) There is a spatially distributed population of $\lesssim$mJy continuum sources,
including hypercompact \hii regions and candidate colliding wind binaries,
around the W51 proto-clusters.  
(3) There are two clearly detected clusters, W51e and W51 IRS 2, but the
majority of the bolometric luminosity in W51 most likely comes from a third
population of OB stars between these clusters.
The presence of a substantial population of exposed O-stars coincident with
a population of still-forming massive stars implies that feedback is ineffective
at halting star formation in massive protoclusters.

\section{Introduction}
\footnote{
This paper and all related analysis code are available on the web at
https://github.com/adamginsburg/paper\_w51\_evla.
}

The highest-mass clusters forming in our Galaxy have masses $M\sim10^4$ \msun.
These rare regions mark the high end of the protocluster mass function, and
recent surveys have provided a complete census of all protoclusters in this
high mass range \citep{Ginsburg2012a,Urquhart2013b,Urquhart2014b}.  As the
most massive and dense star-forming regions in the Galaxy, these locations
provide an important local analogue the early universe, where stars more
commonly formed in clusters and generally formed in denser gas
\citep{Kruijssen2012a,Madau2014a}.

In such environments, feedback from massive stars is a major factor.  Most star
formation within high-mass clusters is likely to occur after at least one
high-mass star has turned on.  Many open questions remain about the effects of
this feedback, as the physical complexity of such regions means they have been
difficult to simulate.  A crucial question is whether the clusters complete the
star formation process by consuming all of their gas, by \emph{exhaustion}, or
by removing it via feedback, by \emph{expulsion}
\citep{Longmore2014a,Matzner2015a}, since this distinction governs whether the
forming stars will be observable as a bound cluster or an expanding OB
association.

W51 contains two of the best candidates for protoclusters that will experience
gas exhaustion, and the region is already extremely luminous.  Of all the star
forming regions included in the Red MSX Survey, which is complete to sources
with infrared luminosity $L>10^4$ \lsun, W51 is the most luminous
\citep{Urquhart2014a} and among the closest at a parallax-measured distance of
5.41 kpc \citep{Sato2010a,Xu2009a}.  The total luminosity of the W51
protocluster complex has been estimated using IRAS and KAO,
$L_{bol}\sim9.3\ee{6} (D/5.4\mathrm{kpc})^2$ \lsun
\citep{Harvey1986a,Sievers1991a}.  

As one of the most luminous star-forming regions in our Galaxy, W51 has been
well-studied in the radio and millimeter.  
Previous works have shown that the protoclusters within W51 contain many
forming massive stars. Five high-mass protostars have been clearly identified:
W51 North, W51e8, W51e2w, W52e2e, and W51e2nw
\citep{Zhang1997a,Keto2008b,Zapata2008a,Zapata2009a,Zapata2010a,Shi2010b,Shi2010a,Goddi2015a}
Another handful have already reached the main sequence and are visible in the
infrared \citep{Goldader1994a,Okumura2000a,Kumar2004a,Barbosa2008a,Figueredo2008a}.

W51 contains many independent \hii regions.  These are classified as extended
\hii regions if they are large ($\sim10 pc$), ultracompact \hii regions
(\uchii's) if they have $r\sim0.1$ pc, or hypercompact \hii regions (\hchii's)
if they are tiny, $r<0.05$ pc or $2\arcsec$ at the distance to W51
\citep{Kurtz2002a}.  About ten of these \hchii regions, which are the youngest
\hii region class and likely contain accreting proto-OB stars
\citep{Peters2010c}, have been found in W51 \citep{Mehringer1994a}.  However,
the census of both massive stars and protostars in W51 is incomplete.

We present observations of the inner few parsecs of the W51 protocluster
forming region.  We refer to the whole region, including W51 Main (which
contains the W51e sources) and W51 IRS 2 as `W51A'.  Other names are explained
when they are used.  An overview of the names used, including labels, is in the
Appendix.

In Section \ref{sec:observations}, we describe the observations and data
reduction.  Section \ref{sec:results} presents the observational results,
summarizing key features identified in the images and describing the
point-source photometry (\S \ref{sec:pointsources}).  Section
\ref{sec:analysis} provides analysis and interpretation of the observational
results.  Section \ref{sec:discussion} discusses the importance of the
observations.  Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

Finally, we include the following appendices: Appendix
\ref{sec:appendix_labels} provides figures labeling named objects,
\ref{sec:SEDs} provides cutout images and SED plots for all point sources,
\ref{sec:obsmeta} includes tables of observational metadata, and
\ref{sec:vfield} shows the velocity field of the molecular gas.


\section{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}
We used the JVLA in multiple bands and configurations. 
The observations and resulting images are summarized in Table
\ref{tab:observations}.  The complete observational metadata, including times
of observation and program IDs, are in Table \ref{tab:obs_meta}.  In project
12B-365, we observed in A-array in S and C bands with 2 GHz total bandwidth.
In project 13A-064, we observed in C-Band in C (1h) and A (5h) arrays and in
Ku-band in D (1h) and B (5h) arrays.  Our spectral coverage included \ortho
\oneone 4.82966 GHz and \twotwo at 14.488 GHz with 0.3 \kms resolution and the
radio recombination lines (RRLs) H77$\alpha$ (14.1286 GHz) and H110$\alpha$
(4.8741 GHz) at 1 \kms resolution.  The H110$\alpha$ line had lower S/N than
the H77$\alpha$ line but was otherwise similar, so it is not discussed any more
in this paper.


Data reduction was performed using CASA\footnote{\url{http://casa.nrao.edu}}
\citep{McMullin2007a}.  The pipeline-calibrated products were
used, then imaging was performed using CLEAN.  For most images discussed here, we
used uniform weighting.  The reduction scripts are included in a repository
\url{https://github.com/adamginsburg/w51evlareductionscripts}.

\input{tables/observations.tex}

While the noise levels in the images are frequently low, we did not achieve a
thermal-noise-limited image in any of the 13A-064 data.  For example, in the
C-band A-array data, the thermal noise is $\sim5$ \microjy, while the achieved
RMS is $\sim30-60$ \microjy.  The images are generally artifact-dominated
at the low-signal end, where inadequately cleaned sidelobes of bright features
provide significant non-gaussian noise.  Some of these artifacts can be seen
in Figure \ref{fig:coverview}.

Despite the deficiency in the image quality, the new observations are
$\sim5\times$ more sensitive than any previous observations in bands that were
previously observed, and the new observations cover a much broader range of
frequencies.  Table \ref{tab:observations} gives the estimated noise in each 
image and an estimate of the dynamic range, which is the peak intensity in the
image divided by the noise measured in a signal-free region of the image.  

Figures \ref{fig:kuoverview} and \ref{fig:coverview} show the best-quality
images in the Ku-band and C-band combining the short and long array
configurations.  These were made from a combination of the full bandwidth in
their respective bands, so each image includes 2 GHz of bandwidth.  These
images are used in the images in the main text of the paper, and they were used
for source identification, but they were not used for photometry.  Instead, for
the 13A-064 data, individual 1 GHz bands including only the longer-baseline
configuration were used for photometry.

For the spectral line analysis, we used the cubes listed in Table
\ref{tab:cubes}.  For the Ku-band naturally-weighted cube, the noise is higher
than in the robust-weighted cube because large angular scale artifacts are
prevalent, especially at the image edges.

In some figures, we show unsharp-masked versions of the data.  These are
equivalent to maps made excluding short baselines, but we instead performed
unsharp masking (subtracting a gaussian-smoothed version of the image from
itself) in the image domain for computational convenience.

\section{Observational Results}
\label{sec:results}
We report seven distinct observational results: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Section \ref{sec:pointsources}: The detection of new continuum
        sources, many of which are  hypercompact \hii regions. 
    \item Section \ref{sec:variability}: The detection of variability in
        some of the faint point sources over a 20 year timescale
    \item Section \ref{sec:associations}: The detection of radio continuum
        sources associated with near-infrared sources, most likely un-embedded
        O-stars
    \item Section \ref{sec:twotwoemission}: The detection of \formaldehyde
        \twotwo emission around sources e2, e8, and W51 North
    \item Section \ref{sec:LOSvelo}: Measurements of line-of-sight velocities
        toward many ultracompact \hii regions using H77$\alpha$ and/or
        \formaldehyde
    \item Section \ref{sec:diffuseemission}: Detection of Orion-bar-like sharp
        edges to the W51 Main \hii region, most likely tracing a
        photon-dominated region (PDR)
    \item Section \ref{sec:lacyjet}: Detection of a $\sim0.1$ pc ionized
        outflow in H77$\alpha$ that had previously been seen in mid-infrared
        ionized line emission.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Continuum sources and photometry}
\label{sec:pointsources}
Our data are the most sensitive continuum observations yet performed on the W51
region.  We report new detections of several sources and concrete
identifications of others that were detected in previous data sets but not
reported.

We follow the naming scheme introduced by \citet{Mehringer1994a}.  For the
compact ($r<1\arcsec$) sources within 1 arcminute of W51e2, we use the name
W51e followed by a number.  We identify two new sources, e9 (19:23:43.654
+14:30:26.81) and e10 (19:23:43.956 +14:30:26.95), which were previously
detected but never officially named (as far as we were able to discover).
We additionally split source e8 into a north and south component, plus a more
extended molecular component e8mol.  We also identify a molecular component
between e1, e8, and e10, which we label e10mol.  The source positions
and approximate radii for resolved sources are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:coverview_pointsrcs} and listed in Table \ref{tab:positions}.

\input{tables/source_positions.tex}

We include in this catalog any pointlike sources (at $\sim0.2-0.4\arcsec$
resolution) with emission in two bands, Ku and C (14 and 5 GHz).  We also
include candidate point sources (denoted with a trailing ? in Table
\ref{tab:contsrcs}) that may instead be artifacts from the data reduction
process.  In order to identify point sources, we used uniformly-weighted maps,
which remove much of the extended emission and make point source detection
simpler, but this process can make local peaks of the diffuse emission appear
to be pointlike.  However, for many of the faint and questionable peaks, we
have found clear near-infrared associations (Section \ref{sec:associations})
and have detected the sources in multiple bands, suggesting that the treatment
of these point sources as real is justified.

The point source data is listed in Table \ref{tab:contsrcs}.  The Epoch column
describes the data source: Epoch 1 comes from \citet{Mehringer1994a}, Epoch 2
comes from 12A-274, 12B-365, or 13A-064 (mid 2012-early
2013), and Epoch 3 (C-band only) comes from
13A-064 in 2014. For the multi-configuration combined images, we list the date
of the highest-resolution observations.  Full details of the data origin
are given in Table \ref{tab:obs_meta}.

There are two flux density columns in Table \ref{tab:contsrcs}.  The first
shows the peak flux density within an aperture centered on the source with a
radius equal to the beam major FWHM; the aperture is therefore about twice as
large as the full extent of the source.  The second column, `Peak -
Background', shows the peak flux density minus the minimum flux density in a
box $6\times6$ beam FWHMs.  This background-subtracted flux density is meant to
account for negative bowling that affects parts of the images; there are cases
in which a bright point source is seen on a deeply negative background such
that the measured peak flux density is near zero.  When these two values agree,
they are reliable, but when they differ significantly, they are probably
affected by image reconstruction artifacts and the background-subtracted
version is preferred.

The RMS column gives the error measured in a signal-free region of the image.
It should be approximately the same as that shown in Table
\ref{tab:observations}, though slightly different regions are used in each
case.

\input{tables/pointsource_photometry.tex}

Figure \ref{fig:d4sed} shows the cutout images with apertures for the source
d4e.  Additional figures for all candidates are included in Appendix
\ref{sec:SEDs}.

\Figure{figures/pointsource_seds/d4e_SED.png}
{Cutouts of the source W51 d4e and its SED.
The red circle shows the source aperture used to measure the peak and total
flux density.  The red line shows a 1\arcsec scalebar.  The Epochs are indicated as E1,
E2, and E3.
In the SED plot, the dark and light red show the 1-$\sigma$ and 3-$\sigma$
noise levels.  The SED plot is shown twice, first linear-linear, and second
linear-log.
Green points are from Epoch 1, blue points are Epoch 2, and red points are
Epoch 3.  Squares show the peak flux density, circles show the
`background-subtracted' flux density - i.e., the peak minus the minimum value
in the map.
The dotted curve shows a linear SED ($S_\nu \propto \nu$) and the dashed shows
a power-law curve with $\alpha=2$, i.e. $S_\nu \propto \nu^2$.  Both curves are
normalized to go through the 12.1 GHz Epoch 2 data point.  In this case, all of
the Epoch 1 (green) points are within the noise, while all of the Epoch 2 and 3
(blue and red) points are detected at $>5$-$\sigma$.
}
{fig:d4sed}{0.5}{6.5in}

\subsubsection{Variability}
\label{sec:variability}
The multi-epoch data demonstrate that at least one of these sources is
variable.  The most convincing case for variability is in the (double) source
d4 (Figure \ref{fig:d4sed}).  In the \citet{Mehringer1994a} data, there is no
hint of emission at this location, with a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.6 mJy.
At the same position and frequency in 2014, there is a $1.0 \pm 0.06$ mJy
source at the position of d4e.  The case for variability in other sources is
weaker but nonetheless suggestive.


\subsubsection{Source Associations}
\label{sec:associations}
We compare our extracted source catalog with the MOXC Chandra X-ray catalog
\citep{Townsley2014a} and the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey
\citep[UGPS;][]{Lucas2008a}.  The associations are listed in Table
\ref{tab:associations}.  We discuss some
individual source associations in more detail in this section.

Both lobes of d4 are
0.3\arcsec from MOXC 192339.62+143130.3 and d6 is 0.3\arcsec from MOXC
192341.23+143111.8.    These
separations may indicate that either the \hii regions or the MOXC point sources
are associated with diffuse material, e.g. outflows,
near stars rather than the stars themselves.  
Candidate sources e20 and e22 are $<0.1$\arcsec from
MOXC 192342.86+143027.5 and 192342.77+143027.5, respectively.
There are a handful of X-ray
sources within W51 IRS2 that could be associated with faint \hchii regions that
we do not detect due to confusion, but these could also be associated with
outflowing material (e.g., the Lacy jet; see Section \ref{sec:lacyjet}).  The
lack of correlation between X-ray and \hchii regions clearly indicates that the
embedded OB stars within these \hchii regions are at most weak X-ray emitters.  

We compared our point source catalog to the UKIDSS K-band and UWISH2 \hh images
to search for infrared associations with our detected radio sources
\citep{Lucas2008a,Froebrich2011a}.  Most of the W51e sources have no
association, as is expected given the high extinction in this region.  The
diffuse region e7 to the south is an exception, associated with UGPS
J192344.79+142911.2 \citep{Lucas2008a}.  Three candidate sources, e20, e21, and
e22, have clear K-band counterparts, though the UGPS cataloged sources do not
align with the evident K-band sources. We nonetheless consider these sources
to have infrared counterparts; likely adaptive optics imaging will be required
to obtain reliable flux density measurements for these due to both point source
and extended emission confusion in the region.   Similarly, e5 exhibits some
K-band emission, though because of the diffuse surroundings, this emission is
not cataloged in the UGPS.

The source d7 is clearly associated with a luminous infrared source, which is
seen both in UKIDSS \citep{Lucas2008a} and NACO \citep{Figueredo2008a} images.
However, the reported position of \citet{Goldader1994a} source RS15 is
0.7\arcsec away, even though in the UKIDSS images there is no detected emission
at this position.  More curiously, the associated MOXC Chandra source
\citep{Townsley2014a} is more closely aligned with the offset RS15 position
than the correct location.  Despite this confusion, we regard the NIR, X-ray,
and radio features to have a common origin.


\subsection{\formaldehyde \twotwo emission}
\label{sec:twotwoemission}
We detect \formaldehyde \twotwo emission around W51e2, W51e8, in a region
between e1, e8, and e10, and in W51 North.  We report the tentative detection
of an extended structure between e2 and e1, though this structure is weak
and could be an artifact from the image reconstruction process.  The fitted
emission line parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:emission22}.  The
emission is shown in Figures \ref{fig:w51northcore},
\ref{fig:w51mainemilabels}, and \ref{fig:w51mainemicontours} and discussed in
Section \ref{sec:h2coemission}.

\input{tables/H2CO22_emission_spectral_fits}

\subsection{Line-of-sight velocities}
\label{sec:LOSvelo}
We have detected H77$\alpha$ emission from many of the ultracompact and
hypercompact \hii regions within W51.  We report their line-of-sight velocities
as measured from gaussian profile fits to their extracted spectra.

The H77$\alpha$ emission line parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:h77a}, and
the \para \twotwo absorption line parameters are in Table \ref{tab:absorption22}.

The \formaldehyde absorption lines give velocities of foreground gas, not of
the \hii regions.  The e5 and e6 sources are close to one another (separation
3.1 \arcsec, or projected distance 0.08 pc), and both exhibit \formaldehyde
absorption at 62-63 \kms.  e6 is detected in H77$\alpha$ at 68 \kms, suggesting
that the true velocity of both e5 and e6 are not the same as the \formaldehyde
absorption lines. 
%    , \emph{but} the line profile of the e6 H77$\alpha$ line suggests that the
%velocity measurement may be affected by image reconstruction artifacts from
%50-63 \kms.

\input{tables/H2CO22_hiiregion_spectral_fits}

\input{tables/H77a_spectral_fits}


\subsection{Diffuse continuum emission features}
\label{sec:diffuseemission}
There are a few new notable continuum emission features detected in our data
that were not seen in previous shallower data.

Near source e11, there is a bow-shaped feature (Figure \ref{fig:e11bow}).
There are no known associated sources at shorter wavelengths, though in Spitzer
bands there is some diffuse emission at this location.  The bow-like structure
points away from e11, suggesting that it is the driving source.

\Figure{figures/diffuse/e11_bow.png}
{A bow-shaped feature toward the northeast of the source e11 in the Ku-band
continuum image.  The feature resembles the bow shocks of Herbig-Haro object,
but is more likely to be an \hii region given its smooth structure.}
{fig:e11bow}{0.5}{6.5in}

The source d3 is a diffuse \hii region with radius $r\sim1.9$\arcsec.  It is
associated with a Spitzer source and the 2MASS source 2MASX J19233591+1431288.
The sources d3, e1, e6, and e7 are compact but resolved (0.02-0.07 pc) and
fairly round; they are therefore classified as ultracompact \hii regions.

The diffuse emission associated with W51 Main traces a broad arc
($r\sim42\arcsec$) that has been seen in many previous data sets.  The new
deeper, higher-resolution data are dramatically improved.  Where in previous
observations, a relatively smooth and clumpy structure was seen, the new images
reveal a network of wispy, filamentary structures.  Figure
\ref{fig:w51mainpeak} shows the region between the W51e and W51 IRS2 clusters.
While this area contains few clear individual sources, it accounts for the
majority of the radio luminosity of the W51 Main region and somewhere between
one quarter and one half the bolometric luminosity of the W51 Main/IRS2 complex.

The filamentary structures in the W51 Main peak are unresolved along the short
axis, with aspect ratios $>25$.   These resemble the ``stringlike ionized
features'' noted by \citet[][see
\url{http://images.nrao.edu/402}]{Yusef-Zadeh1990a}, which are associated
primarily with the Orion Bar PDR and its fainter cousin to the northeast.  The
similarity suggests that these features are PDRs, highlighting the sharp
interaction points between the \hii region and the surrounding molecular cloud.

The two most prominent of these sharp features are on opposite sides of the W51
Peak (Figure \ref{fig:w51mainpeak}, blue arrows).  The long vertical filament
at RA = 19:23:42.4 (Filament A) approximately faces W51e, while the S-shaped
filament at RA=19:23:41.6 (Filament B) faces nothing in particular.  The
presence of multiple features raises questions about the ionizing source.  In
Orion, the Trapezium is 0.2 pc in projection from the Bar PDR.  The left
filament is 0.6 pc from the W51e cluster, which contains enough O-stars to
illuminate the filaments, but it is not clear whether there is a clear
line-of-sight from those stars, which appear to be deeply embedded in molecular
material, to the filament.  It is possible that there are additional OB stars
embedded in the W51 Peak driving much of its luminosity that have never been
resolved because they are confused with the ionized nebula they produce.

{fig:w51mainpeak}{1}{3.5in}

Additionally, the W51 Main ridge is cleanly detected in H77$\alpha$.  Filament
B peaks in the range 40-50 \kms.  From its sharp start toward the southeast,
there is continuous H77$\alpha$ emission toward the northeast from 40 to 80
\kms.

The H77$\alpha$ lines reveal two bubbles that overlap along the line of sight
but are clearly distinct in velocity (Figure \ref{fig:rrl_chan_main}).  A
smaller bubble at 40 \kms shows a velocity gradient orthogonal to the gradient
seen next to filament A, increasing in velocity from southwest to northeast;
this gradient may trace the edges of an expanding spherical shell.  The large
bubble is centered at about 65 \kms and does not exhibit any clear gradients
(Figure \ref{fig:rrl_chan_main}, for labels see Figure
\ref{fig:coverview_diffuse}).

\Figure{figures/rrls/h77a_channelmaps_W51Main.png}
{Channel maps of the H77$\alpha$ line integrated over 5 \kms windows
for the W51 Main region.  There are small ring features notable at low and high
velocities; these are identified in Figure \ref{fig:coverview_diffuse}.}
{fig:rrl_chan_main}{1}{7in}

The \hii region between W51 Main and W51 IRS 2 appears connected to the W51 IRS2
bubble in the continuum (Figure \ref{fig:w51mainpeak} shows the
apparently-connected region, Figure \ref{fig:w51irs2} shows the IRS 2 bubble),
but it peaks at around 75 \kms (Figure \ref{fig:rrl_chan_main}).  Along this
region, there are weak `striations' at PA 126 degrees (parallel to the cyan
arrow in Figure \ref{fig:w51mainpeak}), orthogonal to a line pointing back to
IRS 2.  These striations  may trace the outer edge of the expanding IRS 2
region.  There is also an arc to the southwest of this region that appears to
be a bow shock from gas outflowing along the same axis; the cyan arrow points
to this arc in Figure \ref{fig:w51mainpeak}.

The IRS2 region peaks in velocity around 62 \kms at the center, but exhibits a
consistent gradient from its center to its surroundings, with a more extended
component peaking around 47 \kms.  There is a clear shell around IRS2
with maximum projected radius 21\arcsec (0.5 pc; Figures \ref{fig:w51irs2} and
\ref{fig:rrl_chan_irs2}).  There is a prominent sharp edge feature (blue arrow
in Figure \ref{fig:w51irs2}) extending to the northeast from the central
cluster: it may trace the outflow of hot material from the cluster.

Parts of the shell close to IRS2 are detected in radio recombination lines
(H77$\alpha$), but the more distant regions marked in Figure \ref{fig:w51irs2}
with red arrows are not.  The shell to the northwest peaks at $v_{lsr}=37.5$
\kms, and a gradient is observed from that shell to the peak velocity of IRS2
at $v_{lsr} = 62.6$ \kms.  The velocity structure is inconsistent with
spherical outflow, but it is consistent with a conical flow structure like that
expected from disk-driven outflows (though this flow is driven by a cluster of
stars, not a disk).  This flow structure likely indicates that
the cluster has evacuated a large cavity approximately along the line of sight,
which is consistent with the low observed extinction toward IRS2.

\subsection{The Lacy IRS2 ionized outflow}
\label{sec:lacyjet}
\citet{Lacy2007a} reported the detection of very high velocity ionized gas
in the mid-infrared [Ne II] 12.8\um and S IV 10.5\um lines.  They observed the
gas at a velocity blueshifted about 100 \kms from the IRS2 ionized and molecular
gas velocity.  We have detected the same feature in the H77$\alpha$ RRL.
The RRL shows the same position-velocity structure as the infrared ionized
features.  No redshifted counterflow is detected (Figure \ref{fig:lacyjetslice}).

One minor but notable feature of the H77$\alpha$ flow is that it is very close
to the rest velocity of the He77$\alpha$ line.  If \citet{Lacy2007a} had not
already unambiguously identified the high velocity of this feature in two
lines, we would have assumed it to be slightly redshifted Helium, since
He77$\alpha$ is detected at $v\sim60$ \kms in IRS2.

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}
\subsection{The stellar mass}
\label{sec:stellarmass}

% this work is done mostly in the w51_singledish_maps radial_profile code
We have re-measured the infrared luminosity of the W51 protoclusters using Herschel
Hi-Gal data \citep{Molinari2010a,Traficante2011a}, fitting an SED from the 70
to 500 \um with a single blackbody component.
While this is not a very good
measurement of the dust temperature - multiple temperature components are
evident \citep{Sievers1991a} - it provides a good approximation to the total
infrared luminosity, which is dominated by a single warm ($\sim60$ K)
component.  The infrared luminosity is about $L\sim2\ee{7}$ \lsun within a 2 pc
radius\footnote{In many bands, W51 Main and W51 IRS2 are
saturated, so we have interpolated from neighboring pixels to estimate the flux
density.
Our luminosity is therefore a lower limit.}, which includes
both the W51 IRS2 and W51 Main protoclusters.  It does not include the
mid-infrared luminosity, which may provide an additional $\sim25-50\%$ based on
the IRAS 12 and 25 \um measurements.  Our measured total luminosity is somewhat
larger than the previous estimates based on IRAS and KAO measurements
\citep{Harvey1986a,Sievers1991a}.  A luminosity $L=2\pm0.5\ee{7}$ \lsun implies
a stellar mass $M_{cl} = 6700 \pm 2300$ \msun, with a corresponding number of
O-stars (greater than 20 \msun) $N_O = 19 \pm 6$, assuming a
\citet{Kroupa2001a} IMF at the zero-age main sequence using \citet{Vacca1996a}
stellar parameters.  This is a lower limit on the present day O-star population,
since much of the short-wavelength radiation is able to escape and is not
reprocessed into the far infrared we have used to infer the luminosity.

Of these expected $\sim20$, we know of 6 as infrared-detected, spectroscopically
confirmed O-stars.  \citet{Figueredo2008a} found 4 exposed O-type stars and
\citet{Barbosa2008a} found an additional two with strong infrared excess.  None
of these coincide with ultracompact or hypercompact \hii regions, but all are
in the bright and diffuse IRS2 region.

\citet{Mehringer1994a} found an additional 8 ultracompact and hypercompact \hii
regions, all of which appear to be B0 or earlier based on their radio-derived
ionizing photon luminosity.  In this work, we report a handful more.  The other
9-20 O-stars expected to have \emph{already} formed given the observed total
luminosity may be these most luminous hypercompact \hii regions.  However, it
is difficult to explain the total luminosity of the region from hypercompact
\hii regions alone, since their emission is necessarily confined by optical
depth to a small region, and they contribute minimally to the overall radio
luminosity.  The thermal radiation from the OB-stars in the diffuse \hii
regions may illuminate a large portion of the cloud and contribute
substantially to the
infrared luminosity.

It is possible that the O-stars providing most of the observed
luminosity are near or within the ``shell'' structure of the W51 Main region
(Figure \ref{fig:coverview_diffuse}, Section \ref{sec:diffuseemission}).  This
region dominates the optical and radio luminosity of W51 Main (though it
provides $\lesssim 1/4$ of the FIR luminosity) and is bright enough in
near-infrared and radio continuum emission to make detection of point sources
impossible, explaining why no O-stars have been previously confirmed.  There
are multiple overlapping \hii bubbles in the W51 Main shell at different
velocities (Figure \ref{fig:rrl_chan_main}), suggesting that there are
interacting and  expanding bubbles, which in turn implies that there is a
separation between the driving sources and the \hii region of at least the
bubble sizes, $\sim0.2-0.3$ pc.  This scenario suggests the existence of a
population of un-embedded O-stars spread between the W51 protoclusters.

\subsection{The nature of the continuum sources}
\label{sec:contnature}
% 27 dervied by looking at source_positions table and subtracting extended
% sources

Out of the 27 compact continuum sources reported, the majority are ultra- or
hyper-compact \hii regions.  The ultracompact \hii regions are clearly
identified as resolved sources, with $r>0.005$ pc\footnote{The
\citet{Kurtz2002a} definition of \hchii regions says they should be smaller
than $r<0.05$ pc.  We detect a few sources that are on the edge between \hchii
and \uchii regions, with $r\sim0.05$ pc, and therefore we have identified all
unresolved sources at our best resolution (0.005 pc) as \hchii regions, and all
that are well-resolved as \uchii regions.}.  The \hchii regions are more
challenging to identify, as they are observed only as unresolved sources.
Normally, these could be identified by their SEDs, which should follow an
$\alpha=2$ Rayleigh-Jeans law up to some turnover point, at which they would
become optically thin and turn over to an $\alpha={-0.1}$ power law
\citep{Wilson2009a}.  However, the SEDs we observed do not exhibit such clean
behavior for any cases except e2.  For the rest, we see $\alpha=1$ power laws
at low frequencies (e.g., e4), negative power-laws at low frequencies (e.g.,
e9), or entirely flat SEDs (e.g., e10).  SED classifications for other sources
are given in Table \ref{tab:positions}, and plots of the SEDs can be seen in
Appendix \ref{sec:SEDs}.

An SED with $\alpha\sim1$ or $\alpha\sim0$ can be explained by density
gradients in the \hii region \citep{Keto2008a,Galvan-Madrid2009a,Tanaka2015a}.
However, a minimum at $\sim6$ GHz cannot.  Additionally, an optically thick
\hii region that is just unresolved would have $S_{5 GHz} \sim 70$ mJy, so for
the sources discussed in this section with $S_{5 GHz} < 1$ mJy, the upper limit
on the source radius of an optically thick \hii region with electron
temperature $T_e=10^4$ K is $\lesssim160$ au.  If any of these sources are \hii
regions, then, they are among the most compact of \hchii regions in the galaxy.
% HIIregion_size.py

Negative spectral indices at low frequencies are usually assumed to indicate
synchrotron emission \citep{Wilson2009a,Condon2007a}, but young and forming
stars and \hii regions are generally not strong synchrotron emitters.  However,
colliding-wind binaries (CWBs) often exhibit nonthermal SEDs, likely caused by
accelerated particles in the wind-wind collision zone \citep{De-Becker2013a}.
Stellar winds around massive stars may also exhibit $\alpha<2$ power-laws, but
they are not expected to deviate far from $\alpha\sim0.6-0.7$
\citep{Wright1975a,Panagia1975b,Reynolds1986a}.

CWBs typically have radio luminosities
$L_{rad}\sim10^{29}-10^{30}$ erg \pers \citep{De-Becker2013a}.   At the
distance of W51, this corresponds to 0.5-5 mJy at 5 GHz, so such binaries
should be detected.  By contrast, single star winds range from $L_{rad} \sim
10^{27}-10^{29}$ erg \pers, with only a few known in the high range
\citep{Bieging1989a}, so these are less likely to be detected.

Both CWBs and radio-bright stellar wind sources should be bright in the
optical and near-infrared, with stellar luminosities $10^5-10^6$ \lsun.
Much of the W51 protocluster region is obscured in the infrared by extinction
from the Galactic plane and the W51 GMC, but in the near-IR an unextincted O9
star would have
$M_K\sim10.5$
\citep{Pecaut2013a}\footnote{\url{http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt}},
or $M_K\sim 13.0$ with Galactic disk line-of-sight extinction $A_K=2.6$
\citep{Goldader1994a}.  Some of these stars therefore ought to be detected in
the NIR, and we report such detections in Table \ref{tab:associations}.

Based on these arguments, we have classified each detected compact source in
Table \ref{tab:positions}.  We report 12 candidate CWBs throughout the observed
region.  These sources constitute a large fraction of the un-embedded O-star
population discussed in Section \ref{sec:stellarmass}, and their presence confirms
that un-embedded, main-sequence O-stars reside in the same cloud as the still-forming
clusters.

\subsubsection{The faint radio continuum sources in W51 Main}

The sources e20, e21, and e22 are likely members of a distributed O-star
population, rather than members of the clusters of compact \hii regions (Figure
\ref{fig:w51e20cluster}).  They were detected by \citet{Goldader1994a} in the
K-band at $m_K < 12$, making these the brightest NIR sources outside of W51
IRS2 (Table \ref{tab:associations} gives their associated NIR source names
from large surveys).  Their luminosities suggest they are O-type stars.  Since
they were also detected in X-rays \citep{Townsley2014a}, these are very strong
candidate CWBs.  The high infrared K-band brightness and weak radio
continuum from these sources, in contrast with the bright radio continuum and
absence of infrared emission from e1/e2, supports this hypothesis.  
Assuming they are early O-stars, e20, e21, and e22 are capable of providing the
ionizing and infrared luminosity observed from the W51 Main \hii region.

The three point sources toward the bottom of these images are e20, e21, and e22
respectively.  They correspond to two detected infrared K-band sources from
\citet{Goldader1994a} and have K-band luminosities consistent with spectral
type O4 or earlier.  The other point sources seen in this field are not detected
in the infrared.

{fig:w51e20cluster}{1}{3.5in}


Questions remain: %\todo{Maybe move this into a further discussion section?}
How close are the e1/e2 and e20/e21/e22 clusters?  They are separated by 0.36
pc in projection, but we presently have no direct information about the
line-of-sight velocity of the e20 cluster.    It is likely that the other
sources in this general area that do not have infrared counterparts, e12, e13,
and e23, are also OB stars that are behind infrared dark clouds that obscure
them in the infrared.  It is possible that all of the W51 Main compact sources
are within a $\sim 0.5$ pc sphere.

%Why is the W51 Main \hii region brightest precisely where it is?  The molecular
%gas peaks at e1/e2 \citep{Parsons2012a}, but there is little sign of ionization
%there outside the ultracompact \hii regions.  The \hii region seems to peak in an
%area containing the least molecular gas, which suggests that whatever mass is
%there is predominantly ionized.  The ionized gas seems to form an ionized outer
%shell around the dense molecular gas, suggesting that any further infall into
%this system must happen along thick, shielded flows.

e1/e2 region, and has a clear minimum corresponding to the peak of the radio
continuum emission.

\subsubsection{The faint radio continuum sources in W51 IRS2}

Of the compact radio sources identified near W51 IRS2, all but d2 have infrared
associations (Table \ref{tab:associations}).  Four of them also have X-ray
associations.  Except for d3, which is clearly associated with a moderately
extended \hii region, these are strong candidate CWBs.

An alternate explanation for the SED, location, and variability of d4 is
discussed in Section \ref{sec:d4}.

\input{tables/associations.tex}

%kept as useful notes with some nice refs
% It is possible that some of the compact sources are stars with no surrounding
% dense medium.  The radio continuum emission would then come from either a
% stellar wind \citep{Gaume1993a} or from nearby compact ionized globules, e.g.
% disks around nearby stars.  Particularly for the sources with near-infrared and
% X-ray associations (e20 and e22), the emission cannot come from a
% density-bounded hypercompact \hii region and must instead come from some other
% mechanism.  However, because these sources do not exhibit the typical
% $S\propto\nu^{0.6}$ spectral energy distribution shape, having instead a
% significant excess in the 2-3 GHz band, they cannot be confirmed as
% spherical stellar wind emission sources from their spectral energy distributions.
% \citet{Reynolds1986a} offer explanations for how a non-spherical wind (a jet)
% could result in different spectral indices, but the shallowest they derive
% are $\alpha=-0.1$ corresponding to optically thin free-free emission, so even
% these models cannot explain the long-wavelength excess.


\subsection{\formaldehyde emission features}
\label{sec:h2coemission}

\formaldehyde is generally a good tracer of molecular gas, showing up at typical
abundances $\sim10^{-9}$ \hh anywhere CO is detected \citep[e.g.][]{Mangum1993a}.
The centimeter lines of \ortho are often used as a measure of gas density when
seen in absorption \citep[e.g.][]{Ginsburg2011a,Zeiger2010a}.
\ortho \oneone and \twotwo are commonly observed in absorption
but rarely in emission \citep[e.g.][]{Mangum1993a,Araya2007b}.  The \twotwo
line has been observed in emission in the starburst M82 \citep{Mangum2008a},
behind the Orion nebula
\citep{Evans1975a,Kutner1976a,Batrla1983a,Johnston1983a,Bastien1985a,Wilson1989a},
in $\rho$ Ophiucus B
\citep{Loren1980a,Loren1983a,Martin-Pintado1983a,Wadiak1985a}, and in DR 21
\citep{Wilson1982a,Johnston1984a}.  However, the \twotwo line is more commonly
observed in absorption at large distances within the Galaxy.

We have detected 3 regions of \twotwo emission in the W51 region, all
corresponding to previously detected hot molecular cores
\citep{Zhang1997a,Shi2010a,Shi2010b,Goddi2015a}.   W51e2 is partially
surrounded by a `halo' of \formaldehyde \twotwo emission to its northeast; the
\hchii region itself shows only \twotwo
absorption because the continuum source is bright
(Figure \ref{fig:w51bridge22emispec} and \ref{fig:w51mainemicontours}).
The emission corresponds to the cores W51e2e and W51e2nw and the diffuse
emission between them \citep{Goddi2015b,Shi2010a}.
The \hchii region W51e8 exhibits extended \twotwo emission, including a
somewhat diffuse region stretching between W51e4 and W51e1.  Finally, in W51
IRS 2, there is extended \twotwo
emission stretching between W51d1 and W51d2, adjacent to the ammonia masers
observed by \citet{Zhang1995a} and more recently \citet{Goddi2015a}, and
aligned with the \citet{Zapata2010a} W51 North Disk (Figure
\ref{fig:w51northcore}).

\kms intervals.
}
{fig:w51northcore}{1}{3.5in}

In all cases, the emission is extended and spread smoothly over multiple
velocity channels (Figures 
\ref{fig:w51bridge22emispec}, \ref{fig:w51e2emispec}, \ref{fig:w51e1emispec}).
It is therefore not maser emission.

%There is not a 1-1 detection.  But my judgement on this has varied.
None of these regions have corresponding \oneone emission.  These
nondetections are likely because our brightness sensitivity at C-band is very
poor.  The upper limit is $T_B<300$ K (Table \ref{tab:cubes}), ruling out the presence
of strong
masers.  Additionally, the foreground cloud is a much stronger absorber in the
\oneone line, so any emission is likely to be obscured by foreground
absorption.

The W51e2, W51e8, and North cores share some properties but are not identical.
All three exhibit peak brightness temperatures $T\sim30-60$ K.  W51e8 has a
brightness temperature and spatial extent similar to that of W51 North, though
it is also connected with the e10 molecular emission and is morphologically
more complex.  W51e8 contains a hypercompact \hii region, while W51 North does
not.  However, in W51 North, detection of a hypercompact \hii region may be prevented by
imaging artifacts from the nearby bright IRS 2: it is therefore plausible that
W51 North contains a similar continuum source to W51e8 ($S_\nu \sim 1$ mJy).
Unlike W51e8 and North, W51e2 has a more extended morphology including
the cores W51e2e and W51e2nw, and it includes the bright \hchii region e2w
\citep{Shi2010a,Goddi2015a}.

% see northcore and centroid_north_core
We estimate the mass of the W51 North core in a few ways.  A reasonable lower limit
on the mass is given by assuming it has a volume density $n\gtrsim10^6$ \percc,
which is required to see it in emission in \ortho \twotwo.  Its radius, as
meaured by fitting a 2D gaussian to its integrated intensity emission map, is
$\sigma=0.9\arcsec$ or 0.025 pc (FWHM=2.1\arcsec, 0.056 pc).  If we assume it
is spherically symmetric and gaussian in
all dimensions, the resulting mass is $M\gtrsim14\msun$.
We compute the \ortho \twotwo column density using \citet{Mangum2015a} equation
100, with a measured integrated intensity of 54.5 mJy \kms or 65.5 K \kms given
the $2\times1.5$\arcsec source area.  The inferred column of \ortho,
assuming LTE, is $\sim5\ee{15} - 5\ee{16}$ \persc, depending on the assumed
kinetic temperature and excitation temperature (20-200 K).  This \formaldehyde column
implies an absurdly large mass ($M\sim5\ee{3}$ \msun) for typical assumed abundances
($X_{\formaldehyde}\sim10^{-9}$), so we conclude that the \formaldehyde abundance
must be 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than in the molecular cloud, with
$X_{\formaldehyde}\sim3\ee{-7}$ providing a mass consistent with the density
lower-limit based mass.  For a reasonable range of `core' masses, $10
\msun<M<100 \msun$, the implied abundance is $3\ee{-7} > X_{\formaldehyde} >
5\ee{-8}$.
Using the same assumptions, the $n\gtrsim10^6$ \percc lower limit yields
$M_{e8}>4$ \msun.  Similarly, this core requires high abundance to explain its
emission detection.





\subsection{The d4 variable source \& \hh region}
\label{sec:d4}
The source d4e exhibits $\sim$20-year timescale variability.  d4e has
brightened from $<0.6$ mJy ($3-\sigma$ upper limit) to $>1.0\pm0.06$ mJy.  We
consider a few possibilities for the origin of this variable emission: a
protostellar jet,  a stellar wind, ionized accretion onto a star, or a knot in
a high-velocity outflow.  While we cannot definitively rule out any of these
scenarios, we favor the outflow-ISM interaction because it explains the
coincidence of d4e and d4w with extended \hh and [Fe II] emission.

Protostellar jets exhibit radio emission that can be variable.  Radio
variability has been observed in nearby star forming regions
\citep{Liu2014c,Forbrich2013a} and associated with variability in accretion or
jet related processes, but all sources seen in these regions are orders of
magnitude fainter than d4e, so a jet from a low-mass star is unlikely to be
responsible for the emission.  Radio jets from high-mass stars, e.g., the W75N
jet \citep{Carrasco-Gonzalez2015a}, are also too faint: the expanding jet in
W75N would have a flux density $S_{5 GHz} < 0.1$ mJy at the distance of W51.
Nonetheless, jets are highly variable and may interact with a surrounding
medium of dramatically different density in different regions, resulting in
wildly different luminosities.  We therefore cannot rule out the possibility
that the emission comes from the formation of a jet, and it is even plausible
that the d4 pair represents two opposing jets forming the base of a larger
outflow structure.

In keeping with the SED interpretation from Section \ref{sec:contnature}, it is
possible that the d4 sources are massive stars with strong stellar winds.  In
this interpretation, the overlap with the outflow emission may either be pure
coincidence, or the winds of the massive stars may be interacting directly with
the outflow from IRS 2.  While it is highly unlikely that an outflow would
impact these rare windy stars, the interaction would provide a natural
explanation for the high line widths observed in the infrared and for the
presence of radio emission.  However, the weakness of the NIR K-band detection
($M_K \sim 15$, and apparently extended) hints against this interpretation.

The radio emission could come from ionized gas accreting onto a star.  The
brightest T Tauri stars in the ONC have $L_{rad}<10^{28}$ erg \pers, or a flux
density $S_{5 GHz} < 0.1$ mJy \citep{Forbrich2013a,Zapata2004a}, so it is
unlikely that these are accreting low- or intermediate- mass stars.  These
could be very compact \hchii regions, in which case their variability may be
caused by variable accretion flow \citep{Peters2010c}.  In this scenario,
the source d4e was fainter 20 years ago because the accretion rate was higher,
which meant that the \hchii region was smaller.

The interaction between protostellar outflows and the ISM can result in radio
and X-ray emission at great distances from the driving source \citep[e.g.,
HH80/81][]{Lopez-Santiago2013a,Masque2015a}.  There is a region of \hh emission,
MHO 2419, coincident with d4 \citep[Figure
\ref{fig:d4h2}][]{Hodapp2002a,Froebrich2011a}.  The \hh and [Fe II] emission
come from bow shocks based on morphological and velocity structure in the
\citet{Hodapp2002a} spectra, and these bow shocks point back to an origin in
IRS 2.  The high velocity [Fe II] features ($\pm150$ \kms) are a strong
indication that this is a bow shock from a high-velocity outflow.  It is
therefore possible that the d4 sources are emission features within the bow
shock.  The variability arises because the shocks are short-lived transient
phenomena.  The flux density of d4e and d4w is consistent with that observed
in HH 80/81 \citep{Masque2015a} to within an order of magnitude, though d4
is more luminous.  Given all of the observed coincident features, d4 is best
explained as an outflow knot.  
%Since it is detected in X-rays as a pointlike source,
%some fraction of the X-ray sources detected in star forming regions are likely
%to be outflow knots, but that fraction should be small.

\subsection{The velocity dispersion in the W51e cluster}
\label{sec:vdisp}
We detect H77$\alpha$ toward six of the eight hyper/ultra compact \hii regions
in the W51e1/e2 cluster; four of these six are firm detections and two
are weak.  We also measure a velocity from the \formaldehyde emission toward
e8.  Although the molecular and ionized emission trace dramatically different
processes, we treat the line-of-sight velocities of both tracers as though they
are representative of the stellar velocity for this analysis.  With such
compact \hii regions, the ionized gas is unlikely to be significantly shifted
from the stellar velocity.  The core emission is likely to be dominated by the
densest component nearest the central accreting source.

% vdisp
The resulting 1D velocity dispersion is $\sigma=2.0$ \kms if we exclude
the uncertain sources e9
and e10; with e9 and e10 included the dispersion increases to 4.2 \kms, which
suggests that their velocity
measurements  are unreliable.  This velocity dispersion is confined to
$r<5.4\arcsec$ or $r<0.13$ pc.  Assuming the stars are virialized (which is
probably not a good assumption), the implied mass is 350-1600 \msun, or an \hh
number density $6\ee{5} < n(\hh) < 2\ee{7}$ \percc.

% cluster_properties
The e1 subcluster is more compact, with $r=2.9$ \arcsec (0.07 pc), and its
velocity dispersion is also $\sigma=2.0$ \kms.  It is more symmetric and a virial
assumption may be more accurate here.  Its implied density if it is gas-dominated
is $n(\hh)\sim2\ee7$ \percc ($M_{vir}=200$ \msun), but assuming all 7 \hchii
regions represent OB stars ($M>8\msun$) and the IMF is populated by a standard
\citet{Kroupa2001a} mass function, the cluster should be star-dominated with a
mass $M_{cluster}=700\pm250$ \msun, which implies a stellar density $n_* \sim 4
n_{gas}$.  Given that there are hypercompact \hii regions, implying gas
densities near the stars $n>>10^6$ \percc, this is a region where stellar and
gas dynamics are closely intertwined.

Given the mass of W51 Main and its $\sim10\kms$ escape velocity, all of these
(proto)stars are clearly bound to the overall cluster gas.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{The massive stars and the clusters}
\label{sec:mstarscluster}
There are three distinct massive star populations identified in W51: W51 IRS2,
W51 e1/e2, and the new W51 e20 group.  The W51 IRS2 cluster is closer to
exhausting its available gas reservoir than the W51 e1/e2 cluster, since it is
visible in the near-infrared and shows signs of bulk outflow from the cluster.
Because it contains many stars that appear to have no ongoing accretion and it
has expelled or consumed a large fraction of its gas, it is older than W51
e1/e2.  Similarly, because they have no evident surrounding gas or suggestions
of ongoing accretion, the W51 e20 stars are likely the oldest in the W51 Main
system.
\todo{Clarify that W51 IRS2 is blowing out minimal leftovers; the outflowing
material has low mass.  This can probably be justified by noting that it is 
not molecular and only the edges of the HII region are visible, so the density
of the outflow is very low.  However, that's.... not very quantitative...}

However, W51 e20 and the related W51e candidate CWBs may constitute an
unclustered population.  The Chandra MOXC catalog \citep{Townsley2014a} reveals
that the most evident cluster is W51 IRS2, and while there is a mild
overdensity associated with the W51 Main region, it is more amorphous than
centrally concentrated (Figure \ref{fig:moxconc}).  While it is possible that
the e20 group will merge with the e1/e2 cluster, the later evolutionary stage
of the e20 group (they are not embedded or accreting) suggests that they formed
separately and in smaller groupings.

\Figure{figures/moxc_points_contours_on_cband.png}
{Contours \& individual points showing the X-ray source density from the 
MOXC \citep{Townsley2014a} catalog overlaid on the C-band image of W51.
See Section \ref{sec:mstarscluster}.}
{fig:moxconc}{1}{6.5in}

The W51d CWB candidates, by contrast, are each isolated, and they are
distributed around W51 IRS2 (Figures \ref{fig:w51irs2},
\ref{fig:coverview_pointsrcs}).  These could therefore be runaway stars from
the IRS 2 cluster.  d5 is the furthest of these in projection, so with a
distance of 0.9 pc, its ejection time is $t = 0.08 \left(\frac{v_*}{10
~\kms}\right)^{-1}$ Myr.  The runaway scenario provides an alternate
explanation for the observed SEDs: synchrotron emission from the wind-ISM
bow shock might provide the emission we detect.  This scenario can be readily
verified if high ($>10~\kms$) line-of-sight velocities to the infrared-visible
stars are measured.


\subsection{The future evolution of the W51 clusters and molecular cloud}
The W51 clusters are likely to reach a very high star formation efficiency,
since the escape velocity from them is greater than the sound speed in ionized gas
\citep{Matzner2002a,Ginsburg2012a,Bressert2012a,Dale2014a} and
the \hii regions are evidently very leaky, reducing the effectiveness of
radiative and wind feedback.  If they really are
forming one or more
young massive cluster, though, the gas within $\sim 1$ pc must be evacuated or
exhausted to achieve a final appearance like that of NGC 3603 or Trumpler 14.


While the feedback from massive stars throughout W51 is intense, it is not
halting star formation.  There is evidence for ongoing star formation in both
W51 e1/e2 and IRS2 in the form of molecular cores (Section
\ref{sec:h2coemission}), ongoing accretion onto MYSOs like IRS2E
\citep{Figueredo2008a}, and the many \hchii regions that are likely to be
accreting, despite the fact that most radiation is clearly escaping at least
from IRS2.  This point supports the \citet{Matzner2015a} argument that the
most massive clumps in the galaxy  end their formation by exhausting their
parent reservoir rather than by disrupting their parent cloud via feedback.

The coexistence of distributed and clustered populations over a fairly compact
region affects how their feedback couples to the local cloud.  Because these
populations are nearly coeval and spatially coincident, the feedback from the
OB star population onto the gas within $\lesssim5$ pc is not point-symmetric as
if it were injected from a single cluster.  The distributed population will
render the $\sim5$ pc-scale cloud more holey (swiss-cheese-like) than would be
implied by a smooth or even a very turbulent molecular cloud.  These holes
provide networks of low-density gaps through which radiation can escape,
reducing the overall impact of radiative feedback on the cloud.  Radiative
escape helps explain why feedback has been inefficient at halting further star
formation.

\todo{Examine timescale for IRS2 HII region creation.  HII region is larger
than cluster.  Has had enough time  \& energy input for feedback to disrupt SF
if it was going to.}

\subsubsection{Merging \& age spread}
\label{sec:merging}
Given the high binding energy of the clusters and the proximity of many other
stars, it is likely that some of the observed subclusters will merge.  Merger
or collapse of clusters is a requirement for the formation of massive
clusters in the Galactic center \citep{Walker2015a}, so it is reasonable to
expect similar dynamic evolution here as well.

If any of the observed subclusters merge (e.g., e1/e2 with e20-e22), the
resulting cluster will have an age spread corresponding to $\geq$ the present
age spread.  As a lower limit to the age of the e20 cluster, if we assume it is
responsible for driving the nearest part of the W51 Main shell at a separation
of 0.35 parsecs with a D-type ionization front at $v\sim2$ \kms, we get
$t_{e20} > 0.17$ Myr.  This lower limit is comparable to the gas free fall
time in the cluster and is still consistent with the most accurate stellar age
spread estimates available from photometry of young clusters
\citep[e.g.,][]{Kudryavtseva2012a}.

If instead e20-e22 are part of a distributed population that will not merge
with e1/e2, the W51 protoclusters are embedded within an OB association.  The
OB association will dissolve over a few Myr while the clusters will survive.
However, before this happens, the OB association is likely to shut off
accretion onto the protoclusters.  The radiative feedback from the OB
association can readily ionize the lower-density molecular gas in the outskirts
of the clusters.  In this way, the cluster's formation would be externally
feedback regulated rather than self-regulated.



\subsubsection{Final mass}
The present stellar mass as inferred from the infrared luminosity (Section
\ref{sec:stellarmass}) is a lower limit on the final mass of the cluster.  The
final mass of the clusters will be at least $\gtrsim7\ee{3} + 4\ee{4} \eta$ \msun,
where $4\ee{4}$ \msun is the approximate dense gas mass within $\sim2$ pc and
$\eta$ is a star formation efficiency, likely to be at least 10\% in the dense
gas, so the stellar $M_{final} \gtrsim 1.1\ee{4}$ \msun.

\subsubsection{Cloud-scale feedback}
Since the free-fall time is very short within these clusters ($t_{ff} < 0.5$
Myr out to 2.5 pc containing 5\ee{4} \msun of gas), supernovae will not affect
their formation.  However, once the clusters have exhausted gas locally, they
will remain in the cloud long enough for the stars to evolve and die.
Exhaustion and holeyness also provide a relatively free line-of-sight from the
clusters to the rest
of the cloud.  The binding energy of a $10^6$ \msun, $r=50$ pc 
molecular cloud is only about $10^{51}$ ergs, so a single supernova perfectly
coupled to the gas could unbind it all.  The $\sim20$ O-stars presently formed,
plus at least that many expected to form, will provide more than enough energy
to unbind the whole GMC.

\subsubsection{Evidence against triggering}
The star formation ongoing within this cloud shows no signs of having been
triggered by expanding \hii regions, though there are multiple generations
separated by temporal and spatial scales that might otherwise suggest a typical
expanding-\hii-region-driven triggering
scenario.  The main regions of ongoing star formation at present are W51 e1/e2
and IRS 2.  However, the most evident region of feedback is the W51 Main Shell
(Figure \ref{fig:coverview_diffuse}).  In the W51 Main Shell, there is no sign
of any excess of formed protostars (Figure \ref{fig:moxconc}) and there is a
clear deficit of molecular gas (Figure \ref{fig:contonco}).  Where there is the
strongest evidence of interacting and colliding \hii region shells (Figure
\ref{fig:rrl_chan_main} as discussed in Section \ref{sec:diffuseemission}),
there is no sign of ongoing star formation.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We present deep, high-resolution radio continuum images observed in many
low-frequency bands from the Very Large Array.  These observations have
revealed many intriguing features of the W51 protocluster that together
suggest that thermal and radiative feedback from massive stars is ineffective
at halting star formation in massive protoclusters.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using the continuum data and \formaldehyde emission and absorption line
information, we have measured the velocity dispersion of the W51 e1/e2
protocluster $\sigma_v=2.0$ \kms.  Although this cluster consists of
hypercompact and ultracompact \hii regions, indicating that it is extremely
gas-rich, the velocity dispersion implies a stellar mass that is $\sim4\times$
greater than the gas mass, assuming that the stars are virialized.

\item The SEDs of the point sources detected throughout the W51 A region have
peculiar shapes.  Most of them exhibit an excess at low frequencies ($<5$ GHz)
that renders their overall SED shape inconsistent with either an optically
thick or thin free-free spectrum.  These sources are likely to be colliding
wind binaries, exhibiting a combination of free-free and synchrotron emission.


\item We detected radio recombination line (H77$\alpha$) emission throughout
    W51.  The RRLs trace a number of overlapping bubbles toward the W51 Main
    emission peak and show that the IRS 2 region has excavated a cavity along
    our line of sight.  

\item The \citet{Lacy2007a} high-velocity ionized jet is clearly detected in
    H77$\alpha$ at velocities consistent with its [Ne II] discovery.
    The jet remains mysterious as there is still no direct information about
    what drives it.  

\item We have detected the three massive cores from \citet{Zhang1997a} in
\formaldehyde \twotwo emission.  For W51 North, we evaluated the mass and
derived a lower limit $M>15 \msun$, though it is likely to be significantly
higher.  The \formaldehyde abundance in these cores is enhanced compared to the
surrounding molecular cloud by at least 100$\times$, with $X_{\formaldehyde}
\sim 10^{-7}$, similar to the Orion BN/KL hot core.  In the W51e8 molecular
core, we have found a compact continuum source, indicating unambiguously that
these cores are forming massive stars.

\item Because of its association with high-mass protostellar cores,
    the \formaldehyde \twotwo 14.488 GHz transition is a good tracer of
    early-stage massive star formation.  It is apparently enhanced in
    abundance by 2-3
orders of magnitude over ISM values in high-mass protostellar cores, allowing
it to be detected in emission at long wavelengths.  It will be a powerful tool
for studying the earliest stagest of high-mass star formation throughout the
Galaxy with the Next Generation VLA or a Square Kilometer Array if the
high-frequency end includes this transition.  Ongoing JVLA surveys (e.g.,
KuGARS, PI Thompson, \url{http://library.nrao.edu/proposals/catalog/10267}) may
detect a significant additional population of proto-O-stars.

\item The W51 e1/e2 and IRS2 protoclusters appear to be high-mass clusters
    forming within a larger OB association.  To our knowledge, this is the
    first time a \emph{forming} cluster has been observed within an \hii
    region, though because of the difficulty of simultaneously identifying both
    a distributed and compact stellar distribution, such may be common.  The
    coexistence of the distributed and clustered OB-star populations suggests
    that \emph{external} feedback may be responsible for halting protocluster
    feeding.
